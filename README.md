🧠 Data Structures Used

| Structure                        | Role                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 🔴 **Priority Queue (Min Heap)** | Handles emergency patients by urgency |
| 🔵 **Regular Queue (FIFO)**      | Manages normal patients               |
| 🟢 **Dynamic Array (Vector)**    | Stores treated patient records        |

 ⚙️ Algorithms Used

| Algorithm            | Purpose                             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 🫧 **Bubble Sort**   | Sort treated patients by Patient ID |
| 🔍 **Binary Search** | Quickly find a treated patient      |

 📊 Live System Statistics

The dashboard shows:

* 🚨 Emergency Queue
* 🧍 Normal Queue
* ⏳ Total Waiting
* ✅ Patients Treated

This allows staff to monitor hospital load in real time.

 🛠 System Workflow

```text
Patient Arrives  
        ↓  
Emergency? → Priority Queue (Min-Heap)  
Normal? → FIFO Queue  
        ↓  
Doctor Treats Patient  
        ↓  
Patient Saved in Vector  
        ↓  
Sort | Search | Export
```
